## Database Setup (for Task 2: Course Resources)

1. Make sure MySQL is running.
2. Create the database and tables by importing `resources_schema.sql`:
   - Open phpMyAdmin (e.g., http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
   - If needed, create a database named `itcs333_db`.
   - Select `itcs333_db`, go to the **Import** tab, and import `resources_schema.sql`.
3. The PHP code uses the connection settings from `config.php`
   (host: `localhost`, user: `root`, empty password by default).
